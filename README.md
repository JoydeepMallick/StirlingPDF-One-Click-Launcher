# Stirling PDF One Click Launcher

## Motivation

Laziness!!! 

I wanted to automate the process of starting Stirling PDF in Docker. This script will save you time and effort by launching Stirling PDF with a single click.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you've completed the following steps from the Stirling PDF Docker installation guide:

1. Install and set up Docker.

2. Download the `froodle/s-pdf` image using the `docker pull` command as mentioned in the documentation.

3. Run the `docker run` command in your terminal as specified in the docs.

## Assumptions

Docker Desktop is installed on the C drive.

## How to Use

After completing the prerequisites, you no longer need to manually launch Docker and start Stirling PDF. Simply double-click the provided `.bat` file, and you're all set!

If you're looking for customization, an `.exe` file is also available.

## Note

This solution is currently tailored for the Docker setup of Stirling PDF. Support for other installation options is on the way.
