# Stirling PDF One Click Launcher

## Motivation

Laziness!!!

We Windows users enjoy everthing to run on one click right so is the project intended to.

## Prerequisites

Same as Docker installation guide of Stirling PDF

1. Install and setup Docker

2. Download the `froodle/s-pdf` file using `docker pull` command as mentioned in docs.

3. Run the `docker run` in terminal as mentions in docs.

## Assumptions made

Docker Desktop is installed in C drive


## How to Use

After fulfilling prerequisites you no more need to launch Docker and then click on start to run Stirling pdfðŸ¥¹.

Instead just one click is enough on the bat file provided here.

Want some customization, I have made an exe file.

## NOTE

This is only for the docker setup guide of Stirling PDF, other installation options will be considered.
